## Features

### CreateSummaries script:

- 📚 Reads all relevant files in the project (you can choose what file extensions you want)
- 🧠 Creates a summary (using GPT AI API) representing a mental model for each file, allowing the app to work on larger codebases that wouldn't fit GPT's context window
- 💾 Saves the summary next to each file with a `.ai.txt` extension for later use
- 👀 A watcher continuously updates files that have been modified

### 🖥️ UI script:

- 🧩 Takes into account the TASK and retrieves all the summary files (`.ai.txt`)
- 🤖 Uses GPT AI API to identify relevant files for the task based on the summaries
- 📁 Retrieves the source code of each relevant file and sends it to GPT to obtain the necessary context
- 💾 Temporarily saves the output of each file
- 🔧 Sends the saved output to GPT and requests the required changes to complete the TASK
- 📋 Creates a `.md` file containing the suggestions to accomplish the TASK, along with the source code that can be used

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fjrdomingues/autopilot.git`
2. Do `cd autopilot` to install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create the `.env` file and set up the environment variables:
   1. Copy the .env.example file to .env: `cp .env.template .env`
   2. Set up an OpenAI API key and file with the key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`
   3. Set the path to your code `CODE_DIR=<path-to-your-code>`
   4. Update `IGNORE_LIST=node_modules,coverage,public,__tests__`
   5. Update `FILE_EXTENSIONS_TO_PROCESS=.js,.tsx,.ts,.jsx`
4. Run `node createSummaryOfFiles.js --all` to create a summary of all files (it will also start a watcher at the end for file changes)
5. Run `node ui.js` to input a task and get the AI to give you a solution
6. Solutions will be saved in a `suggestions` folder inside the project directory.

## Test/Interactive mode
This project is still in alpha stage. It's recommended that you use `node ui -i` for an interactive mode here you can review the output of every step before proceeding.

## Components

- **createSummaryOfFiles.js**: Manages the code summarization process for JavaScript and TypeScript files
- **ui.js**: Handles the user interface (UI) interaction and utilizes the GPT-based summaries to complete tasks
