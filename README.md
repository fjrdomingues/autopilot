## Features

### CreateSummaries script:

- üìö Reads all relevant files in the project (you can choose what file extensions you want)
- üß† Creates a summary (using GPT AI API) representing a mental model for each file, allowing the app to work on larger codebases that wouldn't fit GPT's context window
- üíæ Saves the summary next to each file with a `.ai.txt` extension for later use
- üëÄ A watcher continuously updates files that have been modified

### üñ•Ô∏è UI script:

- üß© Takes into account the TASK and retrieves all the summary files (`.ai.txt`)
- ü§ñ Uses GPT AI API to identify relevant files for the task based on the summaries
- üìÅ Retrieves the source code of each relevant file and sends it to GPT to obtain the necessary context
- üíæ Temporarily saves the output of each file
- üîß Sends the saved output to GPT and requests the required changes to complete the TASK
- üìã Creates a `.md` file containing the suggestions to accomplish the TASK, along with the source code that can be used

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fjrdomingues/autopilot.git`
2. Do `cd autopilot` to install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create the `.env` file and set up the environment variables:
   1. Copy the `.env.template file` to .env: `cp .env.template .env`
   2. Set up an OpenAI API key and file with the key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`
   3. Set the path to your code `CODE_DIR=<path-to-your-code>`
   4. Update `IGNORE_LIST=node_modules,coverage,public,__tests__,.git`
   5. Update `FILE_EXTENSIONS_TO_PROCESS=.js,.tsx,.ts,.jsx`
4. Run `node createSummaryOfFiles.js --all` to create a summary of all files (it will also start a watcher at the end for file changes)

    #### *Alternatively...*
    
    After creating the .env file you can configure your own settings in a project-specific json file. To do this, first copy the `myproj.json.template` file: `cp myproj.json.template MyProjectSettings.json`. Now you can run `node createSummaryOfFiles.js --all --cf MyProjectSettings.json` to create a summary of all files using your own json settings file. Any setting here will override those in your .env file EXCEPT the OPENAI_API_KEY setting.

5. Run `node ui.js` to input a task and get the AI to give you a solution
6. Solutions will be saved in a `suggestions` folder inside the project directory.

## Test/Interactive mode
This project is still in alpha stage. It's recommended that you use `node ui -i` for an interactive mode here you can review the output of every step before proceeding.

## Components

- **createSummaryOfFiles.js**: Manages the code summarization process for JavaScript and TypeScript files
- **ui.js**: Handles the user interface (UI) interaction and utilizes the GPT-based summaries to complete tasks
